# Notes:
#
# 1. The small earth parallax residual results in a small discontiunity
#    at the wraparound, which leads an extreme value for the speed at the
#    edge. This leads to spline problems. The discontinuity also leads to
#    ringing when smoothing. Could deal with this by padding beyond one orbit
# 2. It's really annoying that this should be so hard. Maybe it's easier to
#    just skip pyephem and compute the ideal orbit myself.
# 3. The main question we're asking here is:
#     if the object was at position p at time t1, where was it at time t0?
#    Is it possible to answer this question directly with pyephem, without
#    any manual parallax work?
